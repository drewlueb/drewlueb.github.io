            Hello! My name is Drew Luebbert and I am from <b>Kansas City, Missouri</b>. <br>I currently attend 
            the University of Missouri and I am pursuing my Masters in <em>Accountancy</em> as well as an 
            Information Systems and Technology Certificate. I am currently a <em>junior</em> and I plan to 
            graduate in May of 2025 and take my CPA exam shortly after. My dream job is to be a Chief Financial 
            Officer for any sports team. I have played soccer since I was 4 years old. I have been the captain 
            of almost every team I have been on including my high school soccer team. I won a State Championship 
            in soccer in both Kansas and Missouri. I currently am a coach for Sporting Columbia soccer club. 
            I am on staff for the soccer team at the University of Missouri.<br>
