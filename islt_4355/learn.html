                Before the game, a coin flip decides who gets the opening kickoff. Much like the NFL, the team who wins the coin flip can choose whether they want to start with the ball in the first half or in the second half. In order for a ball to be out of bounds, the entire ball must be completely over the line. If the ball goes over the touchline, the team that touched the ball last loses it, and the other team resumes playing with a throw-in. If the ball goes over the end line it is either a goal kick or a corner kick. It is a goal kick if the attacking team touches the ball last and a corner kick if the defending team touches the ball last before it goes out of bounds. A goal kick is taken by the defensive team from the smaller box surrounding the goal. A corner kick is taken by the attacking team from whichever corner the ball was closer to when it went out of bounds. Each team is allowed 5 substitutions during a game, and players that get taken out of the game can not be subbed back into the game. Each team consists of 11 players. There are 4 main categories of players: The goalkeeper, defenders, midfielders, and forwards. There is always one goalkeeper, but the rest (defenders, midfielders, and forwards) can vary in number based on the strategy of a team. The goalkeeper is the only player on the field that is allowed to use his hands, but he can only use his hands in the large box surrounding the goal he is defending.

            <h2 id="positions"><a id="link2"></a>Fouls</h2>
            <p id="positioning">
                When a foul is called, the team that got fouled places the ball on the spot of the foul and resumes playing like a kickoff from that spot, this is called a free kick. Players can pass to a teammate or choose to take a shot from the spot of the free kick, but the player who takes the free kick can not touch the ball twice in a row. If the defending team commits a foul inside their own 18-yard box, the other team receives a penalty kick (PK). A PK is when an attacking player can put the ball on the penalty spot and have a free shot at the goal with only the goalkeeper to beat. Most fouls in soccer are considered common fouls (like offsides) which only award a free kick to the other team. For example, offsides is a foul when an attacking player is behind all defending players when the ball is passed to him. However, there are fouls that may cause a player to be shown a yellow or red card. A yellow card is just a warning to the player. If a player earns a 2nd yellow card, they will also get a red card. A red card ejects the player from the game, that player can not play in the next game, and that player's team will not be able to replace him in the current game. This means that if a team receives a red card, they will have one less player on the field than the other team. Red cards can also be earned without earning a first yellow card if the foul is bad enough. A yellow card can be given for a player consistently making minor fouls, a player being unsportsmanlike, or for a dangerous tackle. A red card can be given for an extremely dangerous challenge, a 2nd yellow card, or for denying an obvious goal-scoring opportunity by deliberately committing a foul.

                The way leagues and tournaments work in soccer is pretty unique to the sport. Almost every country in the world has its own soccer league, but there are 5 main leagues. These leagues are Serie A (Italy), La Liga (Spain), Ligue 1 (France), Bundesliga (Germany), and the most popular league is the Premier League (England). Leagues in soccer are based on points. A win is worth 3 points, a tie is worth 1 point, and a loss is worth 0 points. The team with the most points at the end of the season wins the league, there are no playoffs. There is no such thing as overtime in regular league play. One important thing about soccer leagues is the idea of relegation and promotion. Each country has lower leagues much like the NBA has the G League, or the MLB has the minor leagues. If a team finishes in the bottom 3 of the league, they will get demoted to a lower and less important league for the next season. In return, the top 3 teams from the lower league will get promoted, which can be a massive accomplishment for smaller clubs. A game of soccer is 90 minutes long, with two halves of 45 minutes (plus added time), and the game is not stopped for any reason besides halftime. At the end of each half, there is “added time”. Added time is time added on to the end of the 45 minutes because of time wasted during play and the amount of time that is added on is decided by the official.

                In soccer, there are club teams, which are just regular teams, and national teams which are teams made up only of people born in that country. The biggest club team tournament is the Champions League, and the biggest national team tournament is the World Cup. The Champions League is a tournament made up of the best 32 teams in Europe (the top few teams from each league). The teams are randomly drawn into 8 groups of 4 teams each, this is called the “group stage”. In the group stage, each team plays each of the other teams in its group twice using the point system mentioned in the leagues section. The top 2 teams in each group advance to the next round, the “knockout stage”. In the knockout stage, matchups are randomly drawn from the remaining 16 teams. These teams play each other twice in this stage, once at home and once away. The scores of these two games are combined into one score called the “aggregate” score. If the aggregate score is tied, the teams will play overtime at the end of the second game. If the score is still tied at the end of overtime, the teams do a penalty shootout. In a penalty shootout, teams alternate shooting penalties. Whichever team scores more penalties out of 5 tries wins. The 8 teams that remain after this round are drawn randomly again for the quarterfinals. From here on out matchups are made like a regular tournament (except there are still 2 games per matchup). The final is only 1 game and it is played in a neutral location. The World Cup is made up of the top few teams from each geographical region of the world. The World Cup works the same as the Champions League except there is only 1 game per matchup and all games are played in a host country, which is a massive honor for that country. The World Cup is the biggest tournament in soccer, and in any sport. For reference, the Superbowl in 2022 had around 100 million viewers. The World Cup final in 2022 had almost 2 billion viewers.
