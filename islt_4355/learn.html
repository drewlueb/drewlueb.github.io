            <h2 id="basic">Basic Rules</h2>
            <p id="rules">
                Before the game, a coin flip decides who gets the opening kickoff. Much like the NFL, the
                team can choose whether they want to start with the ball in the first half or in the second half, 
                and the other team will get the option that the first team does not choose. Unlike the NFL, the 
                team that is taking the kickoff is the team that starts with the ball. In order for a ball to be 
                out of bounds, the entire ball must be completely over the line. If the ball goes over the 
                touchline, the team that touched the ball last loses it, and the other team resumes playing with 
                a throw-in. If the ball goes over the end line it is either a goal kick or a corner kick. It is a 
                goal kick if the attacking team touches the ball last and a corner kick if the defending team 
                touches the ball last before it goes out of bounds. A goal kick is taken by the defensive team 
                (usually the goalkeeper) in the 6-yard box. A corner kick is taken by the attacking team from 
                whichever corner the ball was closer to when it went out of bounds. A corner kick usually 
                consists of an attacking player crossing the ball into the box in an attempt for their teammates 
                to score.

            <h2 id="positions">Positioning</h2>
            <p id="positioning">
                Each team consists of 11 players. There are 4 main categories of players: The goalkeeper, 
                defenders, midfielders, and forwards. There is always one goalkeeper, but the rest (defenders, 
                midfielders, and forwards) can vary in number based on the strategy chosen. Teams choose their 
                strategy by changing their formation. Formations are listed as a set of numbers 
                (Ex: 4-3-3, 5-3-2, 4-3-2-1). The goalkeeper is not included in this set of numbers. The first 
                number represents the number of defenders a team chooses to have, the second number is 
                midfielders, and the third number is forwards. The most common formation, and the formation 
                that people use to talk about general positioning, is a 4-3-3. We will use this formation to 
                explain the usual positions in soccer.

            <h2 id="leagues">Leagues and Tournaments</h2>
            <p id="tourney">
                The way leagues and tournaments work in soccer is pretty unique to the sport. We will look at 
                league play and how that differs from most other sports as well. Almost every country in the 
                world has its own soccer league, but there are 5 main leagues. These leagues are Serie A (Italy), 
                La Liga (Spain), Ligue 1 (France), Bundesliga (Germany), and the most popular league is the 
                Premier League (England). Leagues in soccer are based on points. A win is worth 3 points, a 
                tie is worth 1 point, and a loss is worth 0 points. The team with the most points at the end 
                of the season wins the league, there are no playoffs. There is no such thing as overtime in 
                regular league play. One important thing about soccer leagues is the idea of relegation and 
                promotion. Each country has lower leagues much like the NBA has the G League, or the MLB has 
                the minor leagues. We will use the Bundesliga for example. If a team finishes in the bottom 3 of 
                the Bundesliga, they will get demoted to a lower and less important league for the next season 
                (In this case, Bundesliga 2 is the name of that league). In return, the top 3 teams from 
                Bundesliga 2 will get promoted to Bundesliga, which can be a massive accomplishment for 
                smaller clubs. The top teams in the top league of any given country will qualify for some 
                more meaningful tournament, which we will talk about shortly.
