    Hello everyone! My name is Drew Luebbert. I am from Kansas City, and Iâ€™m a junior accounting student at the University of Missouri. I chose this field because it is in good demand and it pays well. I enjoy working with numbers and solving problems. My dream job is to be a Chief Financial Officer for any sports team. I have no past knowledge of web design. I have no goal related to taking this course. I chose this class purely out of interest. I believe the skills I learn in this course could become useful to me as the world continues to use more technology. I may use the skills learned in this class to make websites for fun. My hobbies include any sport you can think of (mainly soccer, tennis, golf, volleyball, and basketball). I enjoy playing video games, listening to music, and anything that involves being active.
