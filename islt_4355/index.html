            With the rise of soccer in the United States over the last few decades it is necessary 
            for Americans to have a way to learn about the sport in a way that they can easily understand. 
            With soccer being the number one sport in the world, most Americans will have some catching up 
            to do as far as understanding the sport goes. This website aims to turn the difficult concepts 
            of soccer into easy-to-understand ideas. Ideas that people are often confused about will be worded 
            in a simple way. This website also hopes to increase the popularity of soccer in the United States 
            as people are able to better understand it. With the recent rise in the popularity of soccer  
            following the World Cup in 2022, more people are finding an interest in the sport which they know 
            so little about. This website hopes to inform these people and provide them with the basic knowledge 
            they need to be a fan of soccer.
